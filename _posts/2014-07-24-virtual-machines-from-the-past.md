Video-gaming isn't just an entertaining and amusing (and, alas, time-consuming) activity.

Quite often video-games brings  some of the most advanced and cutting-edge technologies to us, both in hardware and software. Most frequently people don't even realize that.

The Commodore Amiga was a pretty amazing and (somewhat) underrated platform.
