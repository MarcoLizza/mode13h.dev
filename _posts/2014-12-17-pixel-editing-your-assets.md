Realizing a retro-fashioned game requires a lot of tiny-little-pixel edit.

While a basic paint editor suffice (such as Microsoft Paint) and some valid full-featured applications exists ([Gimp][1] a [Inkscape][2] among the many), one could possibly think and implements his/her personal editor to achieve full proficiency.

Or simply go and use [Pyxel Edit][3].

Just discovered and already loving it. :)
