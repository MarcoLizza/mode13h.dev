The one thing that (almost) always sets me on good-mood is listening to the old [SID][1] music.

There's so much *magic* in those little chips (starting with manufacturing defects that gave them their peculiar tone) one cannot love them.

Being a kid just during the C=64 golden age has been a privilege.

Still remember the hours spent staring the game loading screens while listening to those synth themes. That's perhaps the reason why [Martin Galway][2] has always been my favourite one.

*( granted that there are plenty of SID-musician I hold close to my little-gamer-kid heart )*
