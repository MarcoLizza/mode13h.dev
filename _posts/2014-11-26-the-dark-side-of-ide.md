Microsoft has a long been reprehended for almost any of their products.

However, their Visual Studio has always being praised for being a top-notch tool.

*( quite frankly the IDE itself is a pleasure to work with )*

Finally, along with the older *express* editions, a **free and full featured** [Community][1] edition is available!

Horray! :)
