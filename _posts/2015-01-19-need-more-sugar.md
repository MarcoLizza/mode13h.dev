As written some days in a [previous post](/reinventing-my-own-wheel/), for my current game-engine I chose and used [Squirrel](http://www.squirrel-lang.org).

But, in the very last days I stumbled upon [Wren](http://munificent.github.io/wren/).

It's a young language, but it sounds quite promising.

The syntax is quite compact, juicy and expressive (although I miss the ending semi-color). It natively supports concurrence and generators. The embedding API is simple but essential. Apparently, it's [performances](http://munificent.github.io/wren/performance.html) beats Lua up, too.

And it's (very) actively developed.

To be honest, the language is certainly **not** production ready since it lacks (among the other things) of a debug/trace API facility. But my engine is, primarily, developed to have fun and experiment... so, why don't give to this sugar-coated little bird a try?

*( I honestly think I surely will! )*
